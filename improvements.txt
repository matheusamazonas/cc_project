Extension:
- higher-order functions + type inference
- possibly: lambda expressions (if so, look at closures and value restriction online)


Bigger improvements:
- polymorphic overloading (propagate type frames)
- only include actually-used parts of the standard library 
- move data segment to space after code segment
  x placeholder labels into string postproc to resolve statically?
  x count #instructions + #arguments to find end of code block
  x increase SP at start of __init by #globals - 16 to make space (16 words after code block left open)


Possible little improvements:
- character arithmetic: make TInt and TChar unify, 
  two functions chr and ord (Int->Char and vice versa)
  as a form of typecast (with null body in code gen)
- string literals (convert "lol" into 'l':'o':'l':[] and display as string?)
- for loops (convert to while loop in code gen)
- graceful error when no main available
