Bigger improvements:
- only include actually-used parts of the standard library 
- convert function calls' syntax to allow for calling expressions (counter.fst(), ret_fun()(), etc.)

Possible little improvements:
- list literals (write [1,2,3] instead of 1:2:3:[])
- for loops (convert to while loop in code gen)
