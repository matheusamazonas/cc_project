Extension:
- higher-order functions + type inference
- possibly: lambda expressions (if so, look at closures and value restriction online)

Desirable little improvements:
- test error when print, equals etc. used on functions

Bigger improvements:
- only include actually-used parts of the standard library 
- type check error function

Possible little improvements:
- string literals inside string literals "example: \"literal\" here"
- list literals (write [1,2,3] instead of 1:2:3:[])
- for loops (convert to while loop in code gen)
- a way to output strings/characters without surrounding " and ' (output? display?)
