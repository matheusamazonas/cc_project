Extension:
- higher-order functions + type inference
- possibly: lambda expressions (if so, look at closures and value restriction online)


Bigger improvements:
- only include actually-used parts of the standard library 
- move data segment to space after code segment
  x placeholder labels into string postproc to resolve statically?
  x count #instructions + #arguments to find end of code block


Desirable little improvements:
- graceful error when no main available
- graceful lexer error
- error when print, equals etc. used on functions
- prepend e.g. "[PARSE ERROR]" to parsing errors, etc.

Possible little improvements:
- string literals (convert "lol" into 'l':'o':'l':[] and display as string?)
- list literals (write [1,2,3] instead of 1:2:3:[])
- for loops (convert to while loop in code gen)
- better solution for character arithmetic than chr, ord
